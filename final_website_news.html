      <h2>December Sales Schedule</h2>
      <p>Check out all the champs and skins on sale this December! Like previous sales schedules, we’re not posting the exact dates for each champ and skin, but they’ll all be on sale sometime next month.</p>
      <p>Just a heads up—since we’re publishing these in advance, we won’t offer partial refunds on champs and skins purchased before they go on sale.</p>

      <h2>Patch 8.23 Notes</h2>
      <p>It's time for preseason! This patch is less about the big meta shifts and gameplay evolution you've seen in preseasons past. Our focus is onrefiningyour existing experience so the time you spend playing League is as satisfying as possible. We've got four major themes this year: laning phase is improved and slightly longer; comebacks are more achievable and satisfying; decided games resolve faster; and rune paths no longer dictate stat bonuses. As is customary, there are also bunch of changes that don't fit into those buckets too (Lissandra has a real passive now!).</p>

      <h2>/Dev: More on 2019 Ranked Rewards</h2>
      <p>Hey everyone! Ed “SapMagic” Altorfer here, back again to talk about Ranked. In our latest video we detailed how splits work and how you’ll earn split-based rewards. We also answered a bunch of common questions you’ve been asking. In this article, we’re going to cover a few topics we weren’t able to get to in the video: season rewards, how Honor ties into Ranked, and what we’re doing to recognize players who go above and beyond to demonstrate their skill.</p>
